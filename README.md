# Astro & PHP Application
<< [affiliate.freedomee.com](https://affiliate.freedomee.com) >>

To start local development, open a terminal and type the following (one command at a time):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pedra/affiliate.git
cd affiliate
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open another terminal and type:

```sh
npm run php
```

Now you have two servers running. One managed by Astro at ```localhost:4321/``` and the other by PHP (which must be installed on your local machine) at ```localhost/```, where it will carry out final tests before deploying to the production server.

### ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ inc/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ module/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .htaccess
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

The ```app/``` directory is where the PHP server is written.

The Astro build is directed to the path ```app/public/``` used by the PHP server as a deposit for static files.

### ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./app/public/`    |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
